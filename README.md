Final Project - Interconnection of Data Networks

This repository contains the final project for the *Interconnection of Data Networks* course. The project is developed using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and includes key network concepts such as **VLANs**, **VPNs**, **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, **Routing Protocols**, and more.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IPv4 Addressing
- VLAN Configuration
- VPN Implementation (Site-to-Site / Remote Access)
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Static and Dynamic Routing (RIP, OSPF or EIGRP)
- NAT (if implemented)
- DHCP Server Configuration
- Network Design Topology

## The items to complete the project are:

## 🧪 How to Test

1. Open the `.pkt` file using Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Use the simulation mode to verify packet flow.
3. The next steps will be uploaded after the project is developed.
