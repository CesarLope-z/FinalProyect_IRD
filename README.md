Final Project - Interconnection of Data Networks

## DONE: *99%*

This repository contains the final project for the *Interconnection of Data Networks* course. The project is developed using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and includes key network concepts such as **VLANs**, **VPNs**, **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**, **Routing Protocols**, and more.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IPv4 Addressing
- VLAN Configuration
- VPN Implementation (Site-to-Site)
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Static and Dynamic Routing (RIP, OSPF or EIGRP)
- NAT (if implemented)
- DNS, HTTP, EMAIL Server Configuration
- Network Design Topology

## 🧪 How to Test

1. Open the `.pkt` file using Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Use the simulation mode to verify packet flow.
3. The next steps will be uploaded after the project is developed.
4. Check **ping** between the *PC:César Ing* to *Jefe de planta* it may work
5. In a PC check *Web Browser* and go to **www.empresa.com** it may show a Lost of email address

-note: i'm not sure about the last evaluated point VPN-
